BUG 1: document.getElementsByTagName() command isn't reading page of page but UI itself. 
    FIX: Not sure, need to figure out what to do about it.

BUG 2: everytime the send button is clicked it's reloading the entire element causing AI instance to be re created. 
       
    
         

DESIGN PROBLEM 1: Super slow data processing for AI (prompt based Training)
    Since there's a limit of 60 Requester/minute each api call is limited one call/sec. To process all the chunks it will take atleast 1-2 minutes. 

    POSSIBLE FIX: We merge chunks till  max character limit of single api/second which is around 3000. 
                  This will make it easy in short term but not a feasible option in long term for meaningful effect. 
                  
                  CASE: 10,000 character threshold
                  THEN:
                        10000/3000 = 3.3
                        
                        3000 char worth of chunks per second would take 3.3 seconds to process 10000 character page. 




IDEA 1: 
    Identify each element with the textContent property as opposes to Identifying general elements by tag or class name which 
    contain the text. Traverse the DOM and search for every element that has a text or innerHTML property.
